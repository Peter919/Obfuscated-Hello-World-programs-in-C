# Obfuscated-Hello-World-programs-in-C
Three obfuscated "Hello, World!" programs in C (each file is an individual program). They're only tested using GCC on a Windows device. I forgot that there isn't supposed to be a comma between "Hello" and "World" and I don't wanna touch any of the files ever again.
